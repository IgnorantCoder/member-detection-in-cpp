# README

This repository is reference implementation of "member detection".  
We have some generations of C++, and each generation has optimal technique for implementation of it.  

I have put such implementations to this repository.  
There is only one source file in each directory, you can easily compile and test it.  

## legacy

You can compile by C++03 based compiler.

```sh
clang++ Source.cpp --std=c++03
```

## decltype

You can compile by C++11 and C++14 based compiler.

```sh
clang++ Source.cpp --std=c++11
```

## void_t

You can compile by C++17 based compiler.

```sh
clang++ Source.cpp --std=c++17
```
